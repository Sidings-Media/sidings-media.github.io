## Welcome to Sidings Media


### Who are we?
Sidings Media is a collection of small youtube channels that focus on a variety of topics from model railways to software and electronics. We focus on not only entertaining our
audience but educating them as well. We work on various types of projects, from building a model railway and doing all the intricate scenery to designing software and hardware 
to control models. We focus on keeping everything we do opensource because you cant learn if you can't see the code. We belive that everyone should be able to access our projects and modfy them as much as they want.

### Current Projects
At the moment we are working on a few projects, one of which being our [railway control system](https://sidings-media.github.io/DC-Model-Railway-Controller/). This system will
allow the user to control their DC model railway with a computer.

### Contact us
If you want to contact us with any queries or questions then please contact [support@sidingsmedia.sytes.net](mailto:support@sidingsmedia.sytes.net) and we will strive to respond 
to you as quickly as possible.
